        <h2 class="padded-heading">NHIs and Ciphers: An Introduction</h2><br><br>

<p class="padded-paragraph">Throughout history, humans have reported extraordinary encounters with beings hailing from realms beyond our own. These interactions have formed the bedrock of numerous mythologies, religious traditions, and esoteric lore. These enigmatic entities, often appearing as gods, angels, demons, or fairies, have exerted a profound influence on the very fabric of human culture and the trajectory of our civilization.<br>
Most recently, we have witnessed a surge in reports about contact with extraterrestrial visitors, intertwined with sightings of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) of an apparently technologically advanced and intelligently operated nature. This represents the latest chapter in the saga of contact with non-human intelligences (NHIs). In truth, this continuum traces its roots back across the eons of human history.<br>
This intriguing connection comes into sharper focus when we explore a lesser-known facet of these encounters—a concealed system employed by these non-human intelligences to convey information. This mysterious mechanism revolves around the use of ciphers, cryptic codes designed to convey hidden messages, which can be deciphered and understood by individuals initiated in their use. Over time, these enigmatic beings have employed a variety of cipher methods to communicate their messages.<br>
In the contemporary realm of ufology, our engagements with these entities appear most closely tied to a particular cipher concealed within Aleister Crowley's Liber AL vel Legis, also known as the Book of the Law. According to the famed occultist, this text was bestowed upon him by a discarnate intelligence known as "Aiwass" over the course of three days after a magical working he conducted in Cairo in 1904. The cipher system at play here is called the New Aeon English Qabalah (NAEQ), attributing numerical values to the letters of the English alphabet. Although Crowley himself never fully unraveled this cipher, he harbored a strong suspicion of its existence.<br>
<br>
Chapter II verse 55 of Liber AL vel Legis reads: “Thou shalt obtain the order & value of the English Alphabet, thou shalt find new symbols to attribute them unto”. Chapter III sheet 16 of the original handwritten manuscript of Liber AL includes a grid of numbers and letters, a diagonal line drawn across it, and a cross within a circle. Superimposed on the grid is a passage from the text itself.</p>
<br><br>

	<p class="padded-paragraph">Commencing at the upper-left corner with "A", let us begin by assigning letter after letter of the English alphabet to each cell of this column. Once the bottom of the column is reached, we'll continue at the top of the next column. In this manner, we'll fill out the entire grid. This gives us the following arrangement:
	<br>
	
	<div class="canvas-container">
        <canvas id="gridCanvas2" width="400" height="500"></canvas>
    </div>
	
The "line drawn" is a diagonal spanning from the upper-left to the lower-right. The word "Abrahadabra" comprises 11 letters. Returning to the top left of the grid and moving diagonally brings us to "L," followed by "W," and so forth. "L" is the 11th letter after "A," and "W" ranks as the 11th letter succeeding "L." Continuing this pattern of skipping 11 letters ahead until all of them are covered reorders the alphabet:
<br>

<div class="canvas-container">
        <canvas id="gridCanvas" width="400" height="500"></canvas>
    </div>

Turning our attention to the enigmatic cross within the grid, we locate it at row 7, column 4 — a sum equating to 11 (7 + 4). This arrangement further solidifies the sequence of the letters. However, the task at hand is also to assign values to these letters. We may consider a straightforward approach, beginning with "A" having a value of "1" (due to their shared position in the original grid). Subsequent letters increment by 1, thus L=2, W=3, and so on, until each letter obtains a value.
<br>
Verifying the validity of this system, let's examine Chapter II, Verse 47 of Liber AL: "4 6 3 8 A B K 2 4 A L G M O R 3 Y X 24 89 R P S T O V A L. What meaneth this, o prophet? Thou knowest not; nor shalt thou know ever. There cometh one to follow thee: he shall expound it. But remember, o chosen one, to be me; to follow the love of Nu in the star-lit heaven; to look forth upon men, to tell them this glad word."
<br>
Converting the letters in this alphanumeric string into numbers using our freshly established cipher and summing the entire string up yields 351. Remarkably, this sum aligns with the cumulative values of all English Alphabet letters according to our cipher.
<br>
Furthermore, observing the original manuscript, the string divides into two lines: the first comprises 17 characters, culminating in "Y "; the second encompasses 11 characters, commencing with "x" — written in a way that resembles a multiplication symbol. If we multiply the counts of characters in these lines (17*11), the product is 187 — exactly mirroring the numerical value of "ENGLISH ALPHABET" within our cipher.
<br>
The initial trio of letters — A/L/W or 1/2/3 — collectively sum up to 6. Notably, it's also an obvious anagram for the word "LAW". This intrigue deepens as we unearth that it's the sixth successful cipher that is produced by using different count values starting at 1. (An "unsuccessful cipher," in contrast, gives multiple values for the same number) As mentioned earlier, Cipher 6 entails numbering the letters A-Z by skipping letters in steps of 11, starting at the initial A, assigning 2 to the subsequent letter (L), repeating this 11-step count to assign 3 to W, and continuing this process until each letter in the English Alphabet secures a new position and, thus, an individualized value.
<br><br>
Through modifications to the count, new ciphers can be devised. Is there reason to believe that alternative ciphers are of any significance? There seem to be hints. Take, for instance, Cipher 360 — a geometrical representation of it reveals a circular pattern.
