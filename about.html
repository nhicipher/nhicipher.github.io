        <p class="padded-paragraph">The core objective of this project is to investigate cipher messages believed to originate from NHIs (non-human intelligences). By employing NAEQ (New Aeon English Qabalah) to calculate numerical values of key names and phrases found in contactee cases, and cross-referencing them with Liber AL vel Legis to identify words and phrases with matching values, we aim to gain valuable insights into the operations of these NHIs. While the primary focus will be on NAEQ, we remain open to exploring other uncharted territories of cipher research concerning NHIs as deemed appropriate. Additionally, aside from its connection to cipher research, the subject of NHIs will be covered more broadly as a topic of its own.</p>
